I have use collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.

The dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. The dataset has nu = 943 users, and
nm = 1682 movies. 
I have been working with the script ex8 cofi.m. I have implement the function cofiCostFunc.m
that computes the collaborative fitlering objective function and gradient. 

Af-ter implementing the cost function and gradient, i have  used fmincg.m to
learn the parameters for collaborative filtering.
